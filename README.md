# Product & Hospital Search

## Project Description
Our project is based on both **Product** and **Hospital** domains.  
Although they are independent of each other, the **intention of solving the problem is the same**.




## Team

- **Team Name:** IM GPT

  - Paras Lehana

## Hackathon Theme / Challenge
- **Theme:** Theme 2
- **Challenge:**
Example user query:  
> ‚ÄúWant to buy red or orange LED from Syska or better brands, under 10 wattage.‚Äù

We understand:
- The query refers to an **LED Bulb**, not a TV.  
- **9-watt** will work, but **blue color** should be excluded.  
- **Syska** is preferred.  

This type of intelligent contextual understanding is **not possible with leading e-commerce platforms** at the moment.  
That‚Äôs why we are **hacking the impossible**!




## What We Built & How to Run It

### Steps to Run
1. **Run N8N Workflow tool** using Docker Compose:  
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f N8N/docker-compose.yml up -d

2. Run Elasticsearch & Kibana from official DockerHub images.
3. Run Elastic MCP Server using: 
   docker-compose -f ElasticMPCServer/docker-compose.yml up -d
4. Import N8N workflow:

  Import the file: N8N/My workflow.json into N8N.

    The workflow uses an AI Agent with:

    2 Tools and 1 Model via OpenAI Chat Model
    a) Claude API model (set your API key)
    b) Elastic MCP Server ‚Äì interacts with the LLM to reason and fetch data from Elasticsearch (set encoded authorization key for Elasticsearch DB authentication)
    c) HTTP endpoint for ES ‚Äì since Elastic MCP Server doesn‚Äôt natively support retrieving nested index field mappings, we defined a custom exception in the prompt to call this tool (set username/password for Elasticsearch DB authentication).
