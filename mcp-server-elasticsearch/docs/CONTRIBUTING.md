Elasticsearch MCP Server is open source, and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you!

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code.

Contributions are [released](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#6-contributions-under-repository-license) under the [project's license](../LICENSE).

Please note that this project follows the [Elastic's Open Source Community Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct].

## Setup

1. Install Rust (using [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) is recommended)

2. Build the project:
   ```sh
   cargo build
   ```

   or to build the Docker image, run:

   ```sh
   docker build -t mcp/elasticsearch
   ```

## Start Elasticsearch

You can use either:

1. **Elastic Cloud** - Use an existing Elasticsearch deployment and your API key
2. **Local Elasticsearch** - Run Elasticsearch locally using the [start-local](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/run-elasticsearch-locally.html) script:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://elastic.co/start-local | sh
   ```

   This starts Elasticsearch and Kibana with Docker:
   - Elasticsearch: <http://localhost:9200>
   - Kibana: <http://localhost:5601>

> [!NOTE]
> The `start-local` setup is for development only. It uses basic authentication and disables HTTPS.

## Development Workflow

1. [Fork][fork] and clone the repository
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
3. Make your changes and add tests
4. Fix `cargo clippy` warnings, run `cargo fmt` and `cargo test`
5. Test locally with the MCP Inspector:
   ```bash
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
   ```
7. [Test with MCP Client](../README.md#installation--setup)
8. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr]

## Best Practices
